  # Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for retrieving
  # results. That's because various types of builders may create entirely
  # different products that don't follow the same interface. Therefore, such
  # methods cannot be declared in the base Builder interface (at least in a
  # statically typed programming language).
  #
  # Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder instance is
  # expected to be ready to start producing another product. That's why it's a
  # usual practice to call the reset method at the end of the `getProduct`
  # method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory, and you can make your
  # builders wait for an explicit reset call from the client code before
  # disposing of the previous result.
